## Description

 This full-stack site initially displays 12 photos of Office characters. The user begins the game by clicking on one of the images. The photos will then randomize in order while the user selects another image. Every time the user selects an image, their score will go up by 1. If the user selects the same image twice within their turn, they will be alerted that they lost and the game will reset. Their high score will be saved and displayed in the navbar. If the user successfully selects all 12 photos, they will be alerted that they won, their new high score will be saved, and the game will reset.
